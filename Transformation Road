Transformation Road from a Manual Tester to an Automation Developer
Background:
Was a manual tester and doing the repetitive work everyday. boring and inefficient
a) reconciliation -- file comparison
b) UI testing

Seeking for change:
improve efficiency of recon process
code enhancement based on new feature in UI
automation setup for new UI

how:
start with learning python,  it is a simple elegant language for beginners. have a lot of 3rd party libs to use
watch online courses from diff websites, one is bilibili
read python codes written by someone else
start with simple script: read/write docs, do simple calculations
apply the script in project:  read/compare csv,  find and unzip docs,  generate pivot table dashboard. download artifacts and compare
advanced:  web ui test with selenium,  build my own common modules
